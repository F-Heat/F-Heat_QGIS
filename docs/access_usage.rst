Access and Usage
================

F|Heat is available as a QGIS plugin, which can be accessed and used by anyone from the official extension page in QGIS.
The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/F-Heat>`_, making the tool transparent and allowing for further development.
There is also a `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12806366>`_ entry, which provides a stable version of the software and a DOI for citation purposes.

The installation steps are described in the :doc:`installation` section. The usage and the required steps are described within the application as a window based manual.
We also provide a landing page for the software, which can be found at `fheat.de <https://fheat.de>`_.
