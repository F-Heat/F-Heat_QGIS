Windows access Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Error Message:** ::

    Windows fatal exception: access violation

This error may occur when trying to write the result excel file. Your system might prohibit the plugin from writing an excel file, which causes QGIS to crash. A possible solution is to manually create an empty excel file and picking that as a result output. The result will then be appended to the empty sheet.
