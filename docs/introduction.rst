Introduction
============

F|Heat is a software ecosystem designed for the planning of sector-coupled decarbonized energy systems, particularly in small to medium-sized municipalities in rural regions.
The project is aimed at "democratizing" municipal heat and energy planning by providing an open, transparent, and comprehensible software solution.

Intended Use
------------
The plugin basically provides the basic data for municipal heat planning in accordance with §§ 14-15 of the german `heat planning law <https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wpg/BJNR18A0B0023.html>`_. However, it is also suitable for "only" designing a local heating network and the associated technology for the planning area within a municipality.
The tool is not designed for detailed planning, but provides results in just a few minutes so that different scenarios and network routes can be quickly analysed.
The results can then form the basis for further detailed planning. The plugin simplifies heat planning by automating tasks such as downloading data, customizing files, and visualizing grid areas.
Users can customize network areas and routes to suit their planning needs.


Target Groups
-------------

1. Municipalities, municipal utilities, planners in municipalities that do not have the time, technical and/or financial resources to prepare or have prepared in-depth heat planning/feasibility studies. 
2. Public and energy communities (ger. Energiegenossenschaften) that are committed to the local energy transition. 
3. Scientists and students who want to actively work on the further development of the tool. For this purpose, a development tree is presented and continuously published, which describes the core components. The development team behind F|Heat at Münster University of Applied Sciences monitors and implements the developments, but also drives them forward itself through research projects.
