Overview of F|Heat
===============================

F|Heat is composed of several core components that work together to facilitate energy planning:

- **F|Heat.map**: Manages data related to buildings and roads, focusing on the visualization and analysis of heat planning data.
- **F|Heat.net**: Focuses on designing and visualizing heating networks, including cost estimations.
- **F|Heat.tec**: Aggregates and visualizes annual heat demands, network areas, and supports storage calculations.
- **F|Heat.ai**: QGIS plugin for merging and making the system components usable with an explanatory user interface as an initial step.

These components are provided together in a package, whereby each system component covers a sub-area of the planning and includes different development stages and will go through them in the future (see table in :ref:`components_table`).
The initial user interface is called F|Heat.ai and this also formulates the requirement for future development, namely that the individual components interact with and on top of each other with AI support and enable chatbot and AI-supported planning.
