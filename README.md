# Heat-Planning-Plugin-for-QGIS

## Description
The Heat Planning Plugin for [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) enables functions like status analysis and heat network analysis for municipal heat planning. This plugin facilitates municipal heat planning by giving users access to various Python libraries within QGIS without the need for programming skills.

## Features

It simplifies the heat planning process by automating tasks such as:
* downloading data, 
* customising files,
* displaying suitable heat network areas and 
* a potential network layout.

Network areas and routes can be customised and adjusted during the process.

## Quick-Start

For QGIS users follow the following procedure:
- step 1
