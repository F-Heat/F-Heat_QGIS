<img src="docs/images/fheat_logo.png" alt="FHeat Logo" width="300">

## Description
The Heat Planning Plugin for [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) enables functions like status analysis and heat network analysis for municipal heat planning. This plugin facilitates municipal heat planning by giving users access to various Python libraries within QGIS without the need for programming skills. The spatial resoultion of the plugin is currently tailored to North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) located in Germany.

## Features and Usage

This tool simplifies the urban heat planning process by automating tasks such as:
* downloading data, 
* customising necessary files,
* displaying suitable heat network areas and 
* a potential network layout.

The resulting network areas and routes (streets) can be customised and adjusted during the whole process. The process is about designating the planning region and is based on the [german heat planning law](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wpg/BJNR18A0B0023.html).

## Quick-Start

If you do not have QGIS installed, you can download it from the official website: [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/download/)

Once QGIS is installed, open QGIS Desktop.
